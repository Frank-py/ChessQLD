# ChessQD

## Introduction

ChessQD, developed by Frank Hans and Wertzuz, is an implementation of the ancient strategic board game Chess. The game is played on an 8x8 chessboard, where each player commands an army of 16 pieces, including a king, queen, rooks, knights, bishops, and pawns. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, trapping it in a position from which it cannot escape. This was done as a school project.
